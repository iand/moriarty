= Method Detail =

== get_first_fpmap ==

{{{
public FieldPredicateMap get_first_fpmap()
}}}

Obtain a reference to the store's field/predicate map. This needs to be subsequently fetched using get_from_network

== get_first_fpmap_uri ==

{{{
public string get_first_fpmap_uri()
}}}

Gets the URI of the first field/predicate map in the store. This is much more complicated than first appears since a store can be configured (by Talis) to hold its field/predicate map anywhere. This method understands all the existing stores and their URI layouts.

== get_first_query_profile ==

{{{
public QueryProfile get_first_query_profile()
}}}

Obtain a reference to the store's query profile. This needs to be subsequently fetched using get_from_network

== get_first_query_profile_uri ==

{{{
public string get_first_query_profile_uri()
}}}

Gets the URI of the first query profile in the store. This is much more complicated than first appears since a store can be configured (by Talis) to hold its field/predicate map anywhere. This method understands all the existing stores and their URI layouts.
