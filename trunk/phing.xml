    Phing build script to run the Moriarty Unit tests.
    
    If you have PHPUnit installed as recommended through Pear and also Phing installed
    (I installed this through Pear too) then you only need an environment variable
    set (MORIARTY_ARC_DIR) pointing to your local ARC directory (inc the trainling slash)
    for this to work.  No changes needed in this code.
    
    e.g.  phing -f phing.xml
    
    (There is already a build.xml present, hence the phing.xml - will see if anyone 
    still needs build.xml for anything sometime...)
